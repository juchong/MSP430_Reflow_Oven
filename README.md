Reflow Oven Controller For MSP430G2553 Launchpad

Version: 1.2

Overview
========
This code is used to control a reflow oven. It allows for the option to change
solder types (lead vs. lead-free) before the reflow process is started.
Definitions for both profiles are included in this code. This code is designed to
work with the Reflow Oven Controller BoosterPack designed by Juan Chong. It uses
the MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier breakout board and library, and an on-board LCD 
screen for status display. A PID controller library is used to control a solid state
relay which drives the heater elements in a toaster oven.

Basic Use
=========
When the controller is first started, it will display the splash screen and prompt the
user to select a solder type - lead (Pb) or lead-free (NoPb). The default is lead solder.
If the user wishes to run the lead-free profile, press the Solder Select
button on the BoosterPack/Shield. Once you are ready to start the reflow process, press the
Start Reflow button and wait for the system to run through the reflow profile.
